---TIP CALCULATOR PROBLEM

BEGIN

    ---Step 1: Get user inputs

    PRINT "Enter the total bill amount: "
    INPUT bill_amount
    IF bill_amount <= 0 THEN
        PRINT "Error: Bill amount must be a positive number."
        EXIT
    ENDIF

    PRINT "Enter the service quality (poor, fair, good, excellent): "
    INPUT service_quality
    IF service_quality NOT IN ["poor", "fair", "good", "excellent"] THEN
        PRINT "Error: Invalid service quality. Choose from poor, fair, good, or excellent."
        EXIT
    ENDIF

    PRINT "Enter the number of people splitting the bill: "
    INPUT num_people
    IF num_people <= 0 OR num_people IS NOT AN INTEGER THEN
        PRINT "Error: Number of people must be a positive integer."
        EXIT
    ENDIF

    ---Step 2: Determine tip percentage based on service quality

    IF service_quality = "poor" THEN
        tip_percentage = 10
    ELSE IF service_quality = "fair" THEN
        tip_percentage = 15
    ELSE IF service_quality = "good" THEN
        tip_percentage = 18
    ELSE IF service_quality = "excellent" THEN
        tip_percentage = 20
    ENDIF

    ----Step 3: Calculate tip amount

    tip_amount = (bill_amount * tip_percentage) / 100

    ---Step 4: Calculate total amount (bill + tip)

    total_amount = bill_amount + tip_amount

    ---Step 5: Calculate amount per person

    amount_per_person = total_amount / num_people

    ---Step 6: Display the results

    PRINT "Bill amount: $", bill_amount
    PRINT "Service quality: ", service_quality, " (", tip_percentage, "%)"
    PRINT "Tip amount: $", tip_amount
    PRINT "Total amount: $", total_amount
    PRINT "Number of people: ", num_people
    PRINT "Amount per person: $", amount_per_person
